 - GRU-GAN (window: 5 - one model)
    - Could not print learned distribution yet.                    
    - terrible results. working on it.
       - hyperparameters:
         - change latent space dimension.
         - change latent space distribution (from normal to uniform)
         - resize window.  
       - gan heuristics.
    - Loss always stabilize in 0.68;
    - discriminator predictions are mostly in [0.48, 0.54] interval.
